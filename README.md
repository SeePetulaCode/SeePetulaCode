I am a big fan of Human-Computer Interaction and it’s future. In general, I am fascinated by people and how they interact with products, services, experiences, each other and the world. I will pursue a career that involves prototyping, engineering, and HCI. 

Currently working part time at Purpose Project. Always interested in internships/apprenticeships/nonprofit projects for 2021/2020 (Winter,Summer, Fall).
