I am a big fan of Human-Computer Interaction and it’s future. In general, I am fascinated by people and how they interact with products, services, experiences, each other and the world. I will pursue a career that involves prototyping, engineering, and HCI. 

I'd love to be a part of your team. I’m currently looking for internships/apprenticeships for 2021 (Winter,Summer, Fall).
